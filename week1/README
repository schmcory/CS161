Project 1.a
Use a terminal emulator to log into the school server (flip).  
Type ls to list the contents of the directory you're in.  
Type ls -l for more information about each file.  
Create a new directory called "week1" by typing mkdir week1.  
Go into that directory by typing cd week1 (you can get back out of it by typing cd .. which moves you up one level from your current directory).  
Use vim (or emacs or nano) to make a file named animal.cpp.
Write a program that asks the user for their favorite animal and prints it to console.

Project 1.b
Write a program that calculates how much a garden center needs to spend for a flower garden display.  
The program should prompt the user to enter the cost of the soil, the flower seeds, and the fence.  
It should then calculate and display the total cost.  Format the output to show two decimal places.
Name your program gardenCenter.cpp.
